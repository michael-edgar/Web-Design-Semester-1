        <p>The mAH specification of a battery stands for milliampere-hours. mAH 
           is the amount of milliamperes which a battery can provide (to a 
           circuit or device) for the amount of hours specified in its 
           specification.Thus, a battery if a mAH specification of 1900mAH can 
           provide 1900mA(milliamperes) for 1 hour of time. A battery with a mAH 
           specification of 10,000mA can provide 10000mA for 1 hour of time.
           Being that batteries are sources of power and give out current when 
           connected to a closed circuit, all batteries, whether standard or 
           rechargeable, provide current. Being that they provide current, they 
           come with the specification mAH to quanitify the amount of current 
           that they can within an hour's time. Again, mAH, iillliampere-hours, 
           show how many milliamperes of current the battery can supply per hour 
           of use. Again, as an example, a 1900mAH battery can supply 1900mA of 
           current to a circuit for one hour, and then it will have used all of 
           its charge.Usually a circuit will not demand 1900 mAH of current all 
           at once for operation. A circuit may instead only need 380mA of 
           current for operation. In this case, the battery supplies 380mA for 
           5 hours, since 380*5=1900. Or for other circuits, it can supply 190mA 
           of current for 10 hours, since 190*10=1900. The product of the 
           current consumed times the number of hours in use must equal to the 
           mAH specification.
        </p>
        <p>Thus, our same example, of a 1900mAH battery can be used in the 
           following ways, as examples:
        </p> 
        <p>3800mA for 0.5hours<br>
           1900mA for 1 hour<br>
           950mA for 2 hours<br>
           475mA for 4 hours<br>
           125mA for 12 hours<br>
           25mA for 60 hours<br>
           etc...

        <p>
           The majority of modern smartphones have a internal battery with a 
           capacity of 2000-3000 mAH. How much of this capacity that is required 
           per hour depends on its use. This means, for most people, a 3000mAH
           power bank should theoretically fully charge thir phone. However, due 
           to the fact that the phone is often in use while charging, this is not 
           the case.
