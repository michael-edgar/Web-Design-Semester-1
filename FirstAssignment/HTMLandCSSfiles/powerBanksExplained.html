          <p>Portable Power Banks are comprised of a special battery in a 
             special case with a special circuit to control power flow. They 
             allow you to store electrical energy (deposit it in the bank) and 
             then later use it to charge up a mobile device (withdraw it from 
             the bank).
         
          <!--http://www.instructables.com/id/PowerBanks-How-It-Works/-->
          
             Most power banks have two ports: a USB port for charging the mobile
             device and a micro USB port for charging the power bank itself.
             This means that if users have mobile device with a micro USB port
             (e.g. most Android phones), they only require one cable to charge 
             the power bank and the mobile device.

          <p>
             Most power banks use the unit of electrical power mAh
             (<span class="mAh">M</span>illi
              <span class="mAh">A</span>mp <span class="mAh">H</span>our)
              .For more information about the mAh and why it's used click

              Power banks come in all shapes and sizes, so it can be hard to 
              know which one to get. The big bulky expensive one? The small 
              cheap but flimsy one? The one with a solar cell? To be perfectly 
              honest, the type of power bank you require depends entirely on 
              your situation. Some people may need a big bulky power bank 
              because they may go for long periods of time without electricity 
              or they may be likely to lose a smaller one. While others may only 
              need a small power bank to top up their charge in the middle of the 
              day. Some may not even need a power bank at all! To help you find 
              the type of power bank that best suits you, here is a list of all 
              types of power banks and how they may suit you:

                    through the day</td>

              <tr>
                <td>You can usually get through the day on one charge but some 
                    days you need an extra boost of charge</td>
                <td>2,000 - 4,000 mAh </td>
                <td>&euro;8-20</td>

             Some power banks have extra features that bump up the price.
             For example, a built-in flashlight or solar cell, or maybe it is a 
             reference to a popular game or tv show. Personally, I feel that 
             while some of these features are very interesting, they often make 
             the power bank cost more than they are worth, you could often get a 
             similar power bank without the extra feature and something else with 
             that feature for less much less than the power bank.

              Like all technology, the power bank has also evolved over time. 
              In the past ten or more years, the power bank has developed from 
              a simple combination of a control circuit and a few AA batteries 
              to more complex ones with multiple functions such as LED 
              flashlight and  wifi. The embryonic and development stage of the 
              power bank was 2001-2009. It was first invented in the 2011 Las 
              Vegas International Consumer Electronic Show. As some professional 
              teams started to research and develop the core technology of the 
              power bank it gained its precise definition: the framework of a 
              power bank consists of mostly complete managing circuit, a chip 
              and a battery.
