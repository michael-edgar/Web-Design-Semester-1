    <p>Pok&eacute;mon Go has finally given players a big reason to come back to 
       the game: the introduction of the first new Pok&eacute;mon since it 
       launched back in July.

       Pok&eacute;mon trainers can now catch Ditto, an amorphous blob that can 
       transform into any other Pokemon using its signature move 
       &ldquo;mimic&rdquo;. But there&rsquo;s a catch.
    </p>
    <div class = "clearboth"></div>
    <p>
     You won&rsquo;t see Ditto on the world map, the overview screen where 
     players see which Pok&eacute;mon are around them.<br>That&rsquo; s because 
     it&rsquo;s hiding in plain sight, disguised as other Pok&eacute;mon.<br>In 
     other words, that Ratatta or Pidgey you wouldn&rsquo;t normally bother 
     with?<br> If you catch it, it might be a Ditto.
    </p>
