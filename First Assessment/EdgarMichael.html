    <h2>Email Marketing Strategy</h2>
   
    <p>
      Is your email marketing <a href = "strategies.html">strategy</a> 
      generating the results you want? In 2009, the Direct Marketing Association 
      reported that email marketing has the highest return on investment of any 
      channel, $43.62 returned for every dollar spent. Are you getting those 
      kinds of returns on your email marketing? Probably not. But we bet 
      you&prime;d like to know how! Almost every email marketing campaign that 
      under-performs in terms of profits and influence fails because email 
      marketers pay too much attention to &quot;how&quot; and not enough 
      attention to &quot;why&quot;. What&prime;s working? Why? What&prime;s not 
      working? Why not? Blue Sky Factory&prime;s email marketing strategic 
      services can help you define and implement an effective email marketing 
      strategy that delivers the results you&prime;re looking for. From big 
      picture perspectives of where email marketing fits into your overall 
      marketing strategy to very specific campaign-based strategies, we&prime;ll 
      help you do more.
