    <h1> Euler, Leonhard </h1>
       <h2> (1707-1783)</h2> <hr>
        <p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, Leonhard Euler was born in Basel,
           Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, Jean Bernoulli. In 1731
           Euler became a professor<br> of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences.
           Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books
           and papers. His influence was felt in physics and<br> astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical
           analysis, Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748) remained a standard textbook for well 
           over a century.

        <p>One can hardly write mathematical equations without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e
           and pi , were developed by Euler. He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical<br> analysis which
           demonstrates the relationship between analysis, trignometry and imaginary numbers, in one beautiful and
           elegant equation. 
        </p>

        <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed,
               in the annals of mathematics.
